version 1.0 for Atari STE
released at Sillyventure 2024 WE, 5-8 December 2024

Introduction
------------
This is FASTER, a new silky-smooth 2.5D racing game built from the ground up
for the Atari STE using modern tools, techniques and knowledge.

Features:
- 50 frames per second racing action on a stock 8MHz Atari STE
- Up to 20 large, full-colour sprites on screen drawn by Blitter chip
- 30+ colours on screen from enhanced STE palette
- Full 24 hour day/night cycle
- Simultaneous digital engine noise, sound effects and YM soundtrack
- Screen shaking effect courtesy of STE hardware scrolling

This game is freeware - the only thing I ask is that you tell the world about
it through tweets, blog posts, YouTube reviews, word of mouth etc, so that
everybody knows that the Atari STE is actually quite good after all!

Source code is coming soon - please follow @RetroRacing on Twitter/X for
further updates.
